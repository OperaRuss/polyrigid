The goal of this repository is to give a basic implementation of the Log-Euclidean Polyrigid Image
Registration algorithm as outlined in Arsigny, et al., in the following article:

Vincent Arsigny, Olivier Commowick, Nicholas Ayache, Xavier Pennec. A Fast and Log-Euclidean
Polyaï¬€ine Framework for Locally Linear Registration. Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision,
Springer Verlag, 2009, 33 (2), pp.222-238. 10.1007/s10851-008-0135-9. inria-00616084

This implementation is part of Russell Wustenberg's work with the Visualization, Imaging and Data
Analysis (VIDA) research lab at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering.
